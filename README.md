# FoodBank Connect
## About Us
The Lynnwood Food Bank currently serves over 4,000 households and 17,400 individuals, providing vital support to our community's most vulnerable populations. However, their intake and volunteer registration processes are largely manual, relying on paper forms and in-person submissions. Food Bank Connect aims to modernize these workflows by introducing a secure, user-friendly web application that allows clients and volunteers to submit necessary forms online ahead of time. By streamlining intake procedures, we not only help those in need with more convenient and intuitive access to the food bank but also help volunteers focus on direct service rather than paperwork. 

## Repository Layout
We are still building the layout of this repository and will continue to update it. For now, we will have a folder for important documentation contained in markdown files.
